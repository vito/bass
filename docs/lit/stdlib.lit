The standard library comes with \code{bass} and provides basic language
facilities and support for running \t{thunks}.

\table-of-contents

By default, all \t{modules} inherit from a module called \italic{Ground}.
(Unlike \t{scope} literals which only have the parents they're provided.)

\section{
  \title{\bass{.git} module}{git-module}

  Bare essentials for fetching \link{Git}{https://git-scm.com} repositories,
  using the \code{git} CLI from an image passed on \code{stdin}.

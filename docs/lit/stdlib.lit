The standard library is the set of \t{modules} that come with Bass.

\section{
  \title{ground module}{ground}

  The ground module is inherited by all modules. It provides basic language
  constructs and the standard toolkit for running \t{thunks}.

  \section{
    \title{command input bindings}

    Bass modules always run as commands. Either a user runs the script with the
    \code{bass} command, or another Bass module runs it as a \t{thunk}.

    When a module is run as a script, the values reflect the system values
    available to the \code{bass} command, and \b{main} is called with the
    arguments passed to \code{bass}.

    When a module is run as a thunk, the values reflect the values set in the
    thunk, and \b{main} is called with the thunk's args.

\section{
  \title{strings module}{strings-module}

  Simple functions for manipulating UTF-8 encoded strings.

  \stdlib-docs{{{(load (.strings))}}}
}

\section{
  \title{git module}{git-module}

  Bare essentials for fetching \link{Git}{https://git-scm.com} repositories,
  using the \code{git} CLI from an image passed on \code{stdin}.

  This module is limited to functions necessary for fetching other Bass
  scripts, i.e. bootstrapping.

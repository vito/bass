Hello, world!

This marks the first official release of [Bass](https://bass-lang.org), a
scripting language for all the plumbing that carries software from source to
production.

It has been a wild ride since the initial commit. This release reflects that
the project has found its footing and the core ideas have become stable enough
to confidently build and ship Bass using Bass.

The generated release notes below are not exhaustive as there's no prior
release to compare them to - but I tried to put the major pivots into PRs, for
folks who have seen earlier iterations.
